TeslaKit is a framework written in Swift that makes it easy for you to interface with Tesla's mobile API and communicate with your Tesla automobiles.

# Features
- [x] Authenticate with Tesla's API to obtain an access token
- [x] Retrieve a list of vehicles associated with your Tesla account
- [x] Obtain all data on your vehicle
- [x] Send commands to your vehicle
- [x] Utilizes `ObjectMapper` for `JSON` mapping
- [x] Uses `Structures` to maintain thread safe operations
- [x] VIN Decoder
- [ ] Summon and Homelink - Coming soon

# Inspiration
I have been a long time fan of Tesla ever since the original Roadster. When the Model 3 was announced, I actually camped out overnight so I could place my reservation. I am also a big Apple fan and really enjoy my Apple Watch, although wish there were more interesting complications I could add to my watch faces. So I decided to make my own app while I wait for my Model 3.

Fast foward to mid-2018, I have officially released my app, called [AutoMate for Tesla](https://apple.co/2ylLmOf), on the App Store and have also received my Model 3! During development of AutoMate, I decided to separate the core Tesla API interactions into a separate project and open source it so others could also build really cool apps too.

I am looking forward to seeing what people do with TeslaKit and if you're anything like me and thoroughly enjoy your car and own an Apple Watch, I think you will also enjoy AutoMate so please give it a try!

# Installation

TeslaKit is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod 'TeslaKit'
```

# Usage

Add an ATS exception domain for `owner-api.teslamotors.com` in your info.plist

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSExceptionDomains</key>
    <dict>
        <key>owner-api.teslamotors.com</key>
        <dict>
            <key>NSIncludesSubdomains</key>
            <true/>
            <key>NSExceptionMinimumTLSVersion</key>
            <string>TLSv1.0</string>
            <key>NSExceptionAllowsInsecureHTTPLoads</key>
            <true/>
        </dict>
    </dict>
</dict>
```

Add an import statement for `TeslaKit` into your file
```swift
import TeslaKit
```

## TeslaAPI
Create a new `TeslaAPI` instance

```swift
let teslaAPI = TeslaAPI()
```

Also see other initialization [configuration](#configuration) options

## Access Token
Obtain an Access Token by logging in with your Tesla account credentials

```swift
let email = "e.musk@teslakit.com"
let password = "M@R$R0X!"

teslaAPI.accessToken(email: email, password: password) { (httpResponse, dataOrNil, errorOrNil) in

    guard let accessToken = dataOrNil?.accessToken else { return }

    // Set the accessToken for use with future requests
    teslaAPI.setAccessToken(accessToken)
}
```

## Vehicle List
Obtain a list of vehicles associated with your account

```swift
teslaAPI.vehicles { (httpResponse, dataOrNil, errorOrNil) in

    guard let vehicle = dataOrNil?.vehicles.first else { return }

    print("Hello, \(vehicle.displayName)")
}
```

## Vehicle Data
Obtain all data for a vehicle

```swift
teslaAPI.data(for: vehicle) { (httpResponse, dataOrNil, errorOrNil) in

    guard let vehicle = dataOrNil else { return }

    print("Battery is at \(vehicle.chargeState.batteryLevel)%")
}
```

## Send Command
Send a command to a vehicle

```swift
let command = TKCommand.unlockDoors

teslaAPI.send(command, to: vehicle) { response in
    if response.result {
        print("Command sent successfully!")
    }
}
```

Send a command to a vehicle with request parameters

```swift
let parameters = TKSetTemperature(driverTemp: 21.0, passengerTemp: 21.0)

teslaAPI.send(.setTemperature, to: vehicle, parameters: parameters) { response in
    if response.result {
        print("Command sent successfully!")
    }
}
```

# <a name="configuration"></a>Configuration

## Default
```swift
let teslaAPI = TeslaAPI(configuration: .default) // same as TeslaAPI()
```

The ```default``` configuration points to Tesla's production owner API

## Mock
```swift
let teslaAPI = TeslaAPI(configuration: .mock)
```

The ```mock``` configuration directs all requests to a custom server that returns a predefined responses for each of the owner API endpoints allowing you to work with some real-looking data to work with without having to own a Tesla vehicle or without having a Tesla account at all.

Note: Because this is a free service, requests are occasionally throttled.

## Custom
```swift
let customConfig = TeslaAPI.Configuration(baseURL: URL(string: "SOME_URL")!,
                                          clientId: "SOME_CLIENT_ID",
                                          clientSecret: "SOME_CLIENT_SECRET",
                                          requestTimeout: 30)

let teslaAPI = TeslaAPI(configuration: customConfig)
```

The ```custom``` configuration allows you to specify your own ```baseURL```. This is convenient if you would like to point to your own environment. You can also specify an alternate ```clientId``` and ```clientSecret``` value. You can also specify a different request timeout interval (default: ```30```)

## Debug Mode

```swift
let teslaAPI = TeslaAPI(debugMode: true)
```

Enabling debug mode will print all the raw request and response information to the console (default: ```false```)

# VIN Decoder

```swift
let vin = VIN(vinString: "5YJSA1E2XHF999999")!
print(vin.make)         // Model S
print(vin.driveUnit)    // Dual Motor
print(vin.modelYear)    // 2017
print(vin.serialNo)     // 999999
print(vin.vinString)    // 5YJSA1E2XHF999999
```
